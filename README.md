# Bid Proposal Generator 
This is a lightweight Python automation tool that generates professional bid/proposal letters in `.docx` format. It takes structured data from a YAML file and fills a Word template with that information using placeholder rendering.

This is my **first ever project on GitHub** — built to automate tender documentation tasks!

---

## What It Does

- Reads data from a YAML file (like tender name, bidder name, to-do list)
- Determines what kind of document needs to be generated
- Builds a professional proposal letter body
- Fills a Word `.docx` template with the content
- Outputs the final document to a specified folder
